# Introduction to Python Programming: Experiment#1

This repository contains solutions to three Python programming exercises as part of an Introductory Python Programming Experiment.

# EXERCISES:
1) Alphabet Soup Problem
Task: Create a function that takes a string with its letters in alphabetical order.

Example: alphabet_soup("hello") -> "ehllo"

2) Emoticon Problem
Task: Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence as a string, replace the words smile, grin, sad, and mad with their corresponding emoticon:
Smile -> :)
Grin -> :D
Sad -> :((
Mad -> >:(

Example: emotify("Make me smile") -> "Make me :)"

3) Unpacking List Problem
Task: Unpack a list into three variables: first, middle, last, with middle containing everything between the first and last element. Then print all three variables.

Example: list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Output: first: 1, middle: [2, 3, 4, 5], last: 6

# Implementation:
The solutions are implemented in a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) conatining:
1) Function definitions for each problems
2) Test cases with expected outputs
3) Clear documentation and comments

# Learning Outcomes:
Through these exercises, you will:
- Identify basic codes and functions in Python Programming
- Apply different codes and functions to create Python Programs
- Practice string manipulation and list operations
- Work with function definitions and return statements
