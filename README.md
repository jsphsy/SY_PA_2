# Numerical Python: Experiment#2

This repository contains solutions to two Python programming exercises as part of the Numerical Python Programming Experiment.

# EXERCISES:
1) Normalization Problem
Task: This involves centering an scaling process. Create a random 5x5 ndarray and store it to variable X.



2) Divisible by 3 Problem
Task: Create the following 10x10 ndarray. Which are the squares of the first 100 positive integers. From this ndarray, determine all the elements that are divisible by 3.



# Implementation:
The solutions are implemented in a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) and .npy files conatining:
1) Function definitions for each problems
2) Test cases with expected outputs
3) Clear documentation and comments

# Learning Outcomes:
Through these exercises, you will:
- Identify the codes and functions incorporated in the Numpy library.
- To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a Numpy library.
